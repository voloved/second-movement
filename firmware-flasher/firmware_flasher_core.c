 *  RAM-RESIDENT FLASHER CORE (backend-agnostic translation unit)        *
 *                                                                       *
 *  Everything in this TU runs from RAM on the SAM L22. There are NO     *
 *  per-function section attributes: the build renames EVERY allocated   *
 *  section of this object to .flovl.* (objcopy, see the Makefile), so   *
 *  code, literal pools, .rodata AND statics all land in the flasher     *
 *  overlay (flasher-overlay.ld) -- NOT boot-resident, but copied in on  *
 *  demand by the face's firmware_flasher_overlay_load() at first-block  *
 *  time. Once running, the RAM copy executes, so the flash rows holding *
 *  the original firmware can be erased and overwritten underneath it.   *
 *                                                                       *
 *  --- THE RAM-TU DISCIPLINE (read before touching this file) ---       *
 *                                                                       *
 *  While an NVMCTRL erase or page-write is in flight, the flash array   *
 *  CANNOT be read: any instruction fetch or data load from flash stalls *
 *  or faults. Whole-TU capture makes .rodata and jump tables legal here *
 *  (they live in RAM too; -fno-jump-tables stays on out of caution),    *
 *  but everything OUTSIDE this TU is still off-limits mid-erase:        *
 *    - No calls to flash-resident functions (Movement, watch_optical,   *
 *      libc, libgcc). In particular DO NOT call memcpy/memset, and      *
 *      avoid 64-bit math and division (their helpers live in flash).    *
 *      Copy with explicit loops; use shifts.                            *
 *    - Calls into the linked backend TU are fine (same treatment).      *
 *  Verify with the objdump relocation audit that no reloc escapes to a  *
 *  flash symbol. Reading flash is allowed only when NVMCTRL is idle:    *
 *  that is how firmware_flasher_crc32() can checksum the freshly        *
 *  written image at the end of a session.                               *
 *                                                                       *
 *  Any non-ARM compile of this TU is a hosted test build (see           *
 *  sensor-watch-ir-tools/flasher-sim): the hardware primitives are     *
 *  swapped for test-driver hooks; the protocol logic is identical.      *
