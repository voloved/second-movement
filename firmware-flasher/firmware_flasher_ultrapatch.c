/*
 * UltraPatch decoder TU for the firmware-flasher face.
 *
 * This is the one translation unit that includes UltraPatch's header-only
 * device decoder (patch_apply.h from the `ultrapatch` submodule, on the
 * include path in FIRMWARE_FLASHER_ULTRAPATCH builds; the submodule pin is
 * the wire contract shared with the host CLI). See
 * firmware_flasher_ultrapatch.h for the cross-TU contract with the face.
 *
 * THE RAM-TU DISCIPLINE (see firmware_flasher_core.c's banner) applies to
 * every byte of code and data this TU emits, because the decoder runs while
 * NVMCTRL erases the flash. Like the core, the whole object is captured: the
 * build renames EVERY allocated section with `objcopy
 * --prefix-alloc-sections=.flovl`, routing .text/.rodata/.data/.bss into the
 * load-on-demand flasher overlay (flasher-overlay.ld), copied to RAM by the
 * face at first-block time. Two libc escapes are closed below: memset is
 * redirected to a local RAM copy, and HAND_ROLLED_MEMMOVE selects UltraPatch's
 * private backward-copy loop instead of libc memmove. The build fails if the
 * renamed object still references any flash-resident helper.
 *
 * UltraPatch itself is .ramfunc-friendly by design: no division, no 64-bit or
 * floating-point helpers, no switch dispatch, and all working state lives in
 * the caller-owned PatchApply object (allocated by the launcher, ~6.7 KiB).
