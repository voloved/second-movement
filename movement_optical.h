/*
 * movement_optical
 *
 * Half-duplex, turn-taking stop-and-wait transceiver over watch_optical. Owns the
 * RX<->TX flipping, ACK settle, TX drain, RX idle-resync, and the Movement tick
 * frequency; a face just decides, per received frame, whether to respond.
 *
 * Per EVENT_TICK call tick(); on FRAMES, drain with next_frame() and respond (or
 * not) via send_ack/send_frame. Contract:
 *   - Respond synchronously inside the drain loop; not responding keeps listening.
 *   - On FRAMES you MUST drain to false — an unconsumed held frame blocks RX.
 *   - One response per turn (the first send_* flips to TX; retransmits drop).
 *   - The link owns tick frequency (poll_hz / tx_hz / 1 Hz) and SERCOM open/close;
 *     don't call those yourself while a session is live.
 *
 * settle_ticks (at tx_hz) delays a response sent from LISTENING, letting the peer
 * recover from IR self-saturation; sends from IDLE or with settle_ticks==0 go now.
 * Not usable in low-energy mode; stop() before EVENT_LOW_ENERGY_UPDATE.
