/* =====================================================================
 *  FLASHING PROTOCOL: HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW
 *
 *  Half-duplex IR link, host -> watch data, watch -> host ACKs. Every
 *  frame is a serial_frame {preamble, id, len/flags, payload,
 *  CRC32}; an ACK is just the frame's 2-byte id echoed back (no framing,
 *  no CRC, repeated N times for redundancy on the weak return path). The
 *  host blocks waiting for the id it expects, so a corrupted ACK simply
 *  fails to match and the host retransmits. The flag bits (TEST / ENTER /
 *  VERIFY / PATCH) are defined below.
 *
 *  The session runs as a sequence of stages. The golden rule for the data
 *  stages is STOP-AND-WAIT: the watch ACKs a frame ONLY after it has fully
 *  acted on it (written the row / consumed the patch bytes / verified the
 *  image). So an ACK the host receives is proof of durable progress, and a
 *  lost ACK just means the host resends a frame the watch already handled.
 *
 *  1. TEST  (frame flag = TEST)
 *     A link-reliability warm-up. For each TEST frame the watch flips to
 *     TX, ACKs it, flips back to RX, and STAYS in this stage. Nothing is
 *     committed. It measures whether the round-trip is good enough to
 *     flash, and it stays here until an ENTER frame arrives.
 *
 *  2. ENTER  (flag = ENTER; the point we choose full vs. patch)
 *     - Plain ENTER (empty payload): a FULL (uf2-like) flash. ACK + advance.
 *     - Patch ENTER (ENTER|PATCH|VERIFY, 20-byte reference descriptor): a
 *       DELTA flash. The watch CRCs its CURRENT flash over the reference
 *       range and ACKs ONLY if it matches: proof the patch targets the
 *       right base image. On mismatch it does NOTHING (no ACK); the host
 *       retries or gives up. A repeated ENTER (our ACK was lost) is just
 *       re-ACKed; re-verifying is harmless because nothing has been
 *       written yet. ENTER is the last reversible moment.
 *
 *  3. FIRST DATA BLOCK  ->  POINT OF NO RETURN
 *     Once ENTER is ACKed the watch waits for the first data block. It does
 *     NOT ACK that block from here; it copies it aside and hands control
 *     to the RAM-resident flasher (arm_and_run), which reconfigures the
 *     link raw and never returns. From here the firmware is being
 *     overwritten; the only exits are a verified image (reboot) or staying
 *     parked awaiting a retry.
 *
 *  4. DATA STREAM  (in the RAM flasher)
 *     Both kinds obey the same stop-and-wait policy:
 *         * next-in-sequence  -> act, ACK, advance
 *         * duplicate of last -> re-ACK only (our ACK was lost), no re-act
 *         * out-of-sequence / wrong kind -> do NOTHING (no ACK)
 *         * act (write) failed -> do NOTHING (no ACK) so the host resends
 *     - FULL: the main receive loop acts on each block {addr, 256-byte row}:
 *       erase+write the row, then ACK (id 0 also restarts a full flash from
 *       the top).
 *     - PATCH: the compressed delta body streams in; the decoder PULLS its
 *       bytes from the frame stream (patch_pull_byte), and a frame is ACKed
 *       the moment its last byte is consumed -- a pull decoder only asks for
 *       more input after applying what it read, so the ACK still certifies
 *       durable progress. The same dup/order rules apply inside the source.
 *     Either way a NON-patch id-0 block arriving mid-PATCH is a takeover: the
 *     watch abandons the half-finished patch and restarts as a full flash from
 *     block 0 (the only way to restart a patch, which applies in place).
 *
 *  5. EXIT / VERIFY  (flag = VERIFY, payload = 12-byte image descriptor)
 *     The terminator. The watch DSU-CRCs the freshly written region against
 *     the descriptor. Match -> ACK (echo id) and reboot into the new image.
 *     Mismatch -> do NOTHING (no ACK): the host prompts the user to resend,
 *     and the watch stays in the flasher rather than rebooting into a brick.
 *
 *  So, per frame, the watch does exactly one of three things: ACT-then-ACK
 *  (commit a block / verify the image), ACK-only (TEST frame, or a
 *  duplicate/repeat whose work is already done), or NOTHING (a reference
 *  mismatch, an out-of-sequence or wrong-kind frame, or a failed write).
 *  Silence is the signal that makes the host retransmit.

/* ---- Host-detectable beacon ------------------------------------------- *
 *
 * The host flasher scans the assembled image for this before flashing: its
 * absence means the image cannot receive IR flashes (flashing it would be
 * the LAST IR flash the watch accepts), and its patch_flag tells the host
 * which patch dialect the build speaks, so --patch-format is auto-selected
 * from the reference image. It lives inside the real (HAS_OPTICAL_LINK) face
 * on purpose: a non-IR build must FAIL the check. The magic (8 bytes,
 * including the NUL) is the eternal search anchor and never changes;
 * beacon_version gates the layout of what follows.
 *
 * The face classifies patch frames through beacon.patch_flag (below), so the
 * beacon is genuinely referenced -- the linker keeps it exactly when the
 * functioning face is present, and it cannot disagree with the watch's
 * behavior. The RAM core keeps the IR_FLASHER_FLAG_PATCH compile-time
 * constant instead: overlay code must not read flash-resident data mid-erase
 * (both come from the same macro, so they agree by construction). */

 *
 * Receiving the first data block after a verified ENTER IS the point of no

 * path from here on runs over the IR link inside the flasher (park, block-0
 * full-flash takeover, EXIT verify) -- never by returning to Movement. So
 * the copy proceeds even though the window overlaps what is normally heap
 * headroom: any heap contents above the overlay base are dead weight now,
 * and if state the hand-off still reads from the heap got smashed (possible
 * only if Movement's heap had grown past the overlay base, ~12 KiB), the
 * resulting garbage fails frame CRCs or the decode and the session parks --
 * still recoverable over IR.
 *
 * Only two ~impossible conditions refuse (swallow the block, no ACK),
 * because PROCEEDING would be strictly worse than the host retrying:
 *   - the live stack pointer not clearing the overlay end: the copy would
 *     overwrite the very frames executing it and crash mid-copy;
 *   - the post-copy byte-for-byte verify failing: arming a corrupted
 *     flash-writing engine could endanger the bootloader.
 *
 * The copy also plants a canary word just past the overlay; the core checks
 * it after the decoder backend runs, so a session stack that dug into the
 * loaded code parks the session instead of trusting its output (the EXIT
 * CRC remains the final gate either way). */
