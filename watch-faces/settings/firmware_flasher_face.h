/*
 * FIRMWARE FLASHER FACE
 *
 * Launcher for in-place firmware flashing over the IR link. On boards
 * without the IR sensor this face is a stub (shows "no Ir"), so it is safe
 * to keep in movement_config.h unconditionally.
 *
 * Host side: drive with `bin/firmware_flasher.py` (UF2 flash, full or delta)
 * from the sensor-watch-ir-tools repo, running on an attached modem:
 *   https://github.com/alesgenova/sensor-watch-ir-tools
 * Match the host's --baud / --ack-baud / --encoding to this face's menu settings.
 *
 * The flash session is bidirectional (receives firmware frames, sends
 * ACK/NAK), so RX and TX baud are configured independently. The default
 * 3600/300 split matches the ACK-based stop-and-wait protocol: fast
 * downstream firmware bytes, slow upstream acknowledgements.
 *
 * Flash mode runs in two stages:
 *
 *   1. TESTING: a link-reliability handshake driven by normal Movement
 *      ticks. The host transmits a few test frames; for each one the watch
 *      flips the (half-duplex) link to TX, sends back an ACK, and flips
 *      back to RX. The watch stays in this stage, ACKing test frames, until
 *      the host sends the ENTER frame (which moves it to FLASHING). This
 *      stage uses EVENT_TICK and the watch_optical helper module.
 *
 *   2. FLASHING: the point of no return. Entered when the host's (empty)
 *      ENTER frame is ACKed; the watch then receives the first data block and
 *      transfers control to the RAM-resident flasher, committed until reboot.
