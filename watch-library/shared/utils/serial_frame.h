/*
 * serial_frame
 *
 * Byte-fed state machine that pulls validated frames out of a noisy byte
 * stream encoded as:
 *
 *   +----------+---------+-------------+---------+---------+
 *   | preamble | id      | len + flags | payload | crc32   |
 *   | 4 bytes  | 2 bytes | 2 bytes     | N bytes | 4 bytes |
 *   +----------+---------+-------------+---------+---------+
 *                <--------- CRC32 covers this ---------->
 *                (id + len+flags + payload, the payload padded to a
 *                 4-byte multiple, so the region is always 4-aligned;
 *                 see "Padding scheme" below)
 *
 *   Multi-byte fields (id, len+flags, crc32) are little-endian on the wire.
 *
 *   preamble:  0xAA 0x55 0xAA 0x55
 *   id:        uint16 LE, application-defined frame identifier. The transport
 *              passes it through verbatim and assigns it no meaning.
 *   len+flags: bits [9:0]  = declared payload length in bytes, range
 *                            [0, MAX_PAYLOAD] (0 = a header-only frame with
 *                            no payload bytes on the wire)
 *              bits [15:10] = flags: 6 bits, application-defined. The
 *                            transport passes them through verbatim and
 *                            assigns them no meaning.
 *   crc32:     CRC-32 standard variant (poly 0xEDB88320 reflected, init
 *              0xFFFFFFFF, final XOR 0xFFFFFFFF) over id || len+flags
 *              || padded_payload. Little-endian on wire. Matches Python's
 *              zlib.crc32 / Ethernet / PNG / gzip.
 *
 * Padding scheme: the *declared* payload length can be any value in
 * [0, MAX_PAYLOAD], but the wire carries `physical = ceil(length / 4) * 4`
 * payload bytes; the trailing (physical - length) bytes are padding (any
 * value; the transmitter typically writes zeros). The CRC32 covers all
 * physical bytes including padding. The receiver computes physical from
 * the declared length, consumes that many bytes, validates CRC, then
 * delivers only the first `length` bytes to the consumer (padding is
 * dropped). This keeps the CRC region (id + len+flags + padded payload
 * = 4 + physical bytes) 4-byte aligned, which is what lets the SAML22 DSU
 * hardware CRC32 engine compute it directly with no special-case code (the
 * engine requires a 4-aligned address and a length that is a multiple of 4).
 * On SAML22 that hardware path is what runs; elsewhere a software CRC32 with
 * identical results is used (see compute_crc32 in serial_frame.c).
 *
 * Usage: allocate one serial_frame_parser_t per stream, init it with a callback,
 * then push received bytes via serial_frame_parser_feed(); typically called from
 * a UART drain loop. On each valid frame, the callback fires synchronously
 * with a serial_frame_t * whose pointers are valid only for the duration
 * of the call. Copy if you need to retain.
 *
 * Memory: ~565 bytes per instance (mostly the 516-byte CRC buffer = id +
 * len+flags + 512-byte max padded payload). Safe to allocate on the stack
 * or as a static.
