/*
 * watch_optical
 *
 * Half-duplex framed messaging over the watch's onboard optical link. Which
 * LED, which phototransistor and which SERCOM pads are board-specific and come
 * from watch_optical_config.h; on the Sensor Watch Pro:
 *
 *   RX: phototransistor (IRSENSE) routed to SERCOM0 PAD[0] (USART RX),
 *       phototransistor bias powered via IR_ENABLE while open.
 *   TX: red LED          (RED)    routed to SERCOM3 PAD[0] (USART TX). In IrDA
 *       the SIR encoder idles the line LOW and emits a 3/16-bit HIGH pulse per
 *       0 bit; the optical polarity is fixed by the encoder, not by cfg->invert
 *       (which only inverts data bits; see below).
 *
 *       *** The red LED is active-LOW *** (verified on a scope: idle-low line =
 *       LED LIT, the brief HIGH pulses = LED OFF). So IrDA TX runs the LED LIT at
 *       idle with brief dark blinks, i.e. HIGH duty (~80% on), the OPPOSITE of
 *       IrDA's usual low-duty-pulse power profile. The link still works because
 *       the IrDA receiver is edge/position-based (it doesn't care about light vs
 *       dark polarity), but for the watch IrDA TX is a POWER DISADVANTAGE; it
 *       maximizes LED-on time instead of minimizing it. NRZ (with invert chosen
 *       so the line idles HIGH = LED off) is the low-LED-power TX option.
 *
 * Layered on:
 *   - gossamer's polled UART driver (256-byte FIFOs, ISR-driven internally,
 *     run_in_standby = true so the link stays alive between Movement ticks).
 *   - serial_frame_parser_t: preamble + id + len/flags + CRC32-validated
 *     framing. The CRC region is 4-byte aligned so we can use the SAML22
 *     DSU hardware CRC32 engine on TX (and the parser on RX).
 *
 * Lifecycle (strictly half-duplex; only one direction is active at a time):
 *
 *     CLOSED  -- watch_optical_open(DIR_RX, cfg) -->  RX_OPEN
 *     CLOSED  -- watch_optical_open(DIR_TX, cfg) -->  TX_OPEN
 *     {RX_OPEN, TX_OPEN}  -- watch_optical_close() -->  CLOSED
 *
 * open() fails if a session is already active in the other direction;
 * callers must close() first. The unused direction's hardware (LED pmux
 * or phototransistor bias) is always actively gated off, so the LED can
 * never reach the phototransistor while in RX, and vice versa.
 *
 * Per-tick driving:
 *   watch_optical_poll() is the ONLY function that moves bytes between
 *   hardware and the wire buffers. send(), receive(), and tx_idle() are
 *   pure queries with no side effects. Faces must call poll() once per
 *   EVENT_TICK while a session is open.
 *
 * Tick-rate constraint:
 *   The UART RX FIFO is 256 bytes. Faces must request a tick rate fast
 *   enough to drain it before it fills: at 9600 baud, >= 4 Hz minimum.
 *
 * Static memory: ~1.6 KB total (524 B TX wire buffer + ~540 B parser
 * internal + 524 B RX held-frame slot). All gated by HAS_OPTICAL_LINK.
 *
 * Not usable from low-energy mode; peripherals are gated off there.
 * Faces should close() before EVENT_LOW_ENERGY_UPDATE.
