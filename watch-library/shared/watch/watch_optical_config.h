/*
 * watch_optical_config.h
 *
 * Board-specific wiring of the optical (IR / LED) half-duplex serial link used
 * by watch_optical, movement_optical and the firmware flasher. This is the ONE
 * place that says which LED, which phototransistor, and which SERCOM pads a
 * given board uses; every consumer derives what it needs from the macros below.
 *
 * gossamer's per-board pins.h names the pins (HAL_GPIO_PIN(RED, ...), etc.) but
 * knows nothing about which SERCOM / pad / pin-mux the link rides on, and we do
 * not control that repository. So the mapping lives here, keyed on the board
 * name that the Makefile passes in as -DBOARD_$(BOARD).
 *
 * To add a board: add an #elif defined(BOARD_<name>) block that defines
 * HAS_OPTICAL_LINK plus the WATCH_OPTICAL_* knobs. Boards without the hardware
 * simply have no block; HAS_OPTICAL_LINK stays undefined and every optical
 * consumer compiles down to its stub.
 *
 * Knobs (all required when HAS_OPTICAL_LINK is defined, except RX_ENABLE_*):
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_TX_SERCOM      SERCOM index driving the LED (USART TX)
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_TX_PAD         SERCOM pad the LED pin lands on (0 or 2 on SAM L22)
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_TX_PIN         pin name as declared in pins.h (e.g. RED)
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_TX_PMUX        HAL_GPIO_PMUX_SERCOM or HAL_GPIO_PMUX_SERCOM_ALT
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_RX_SERCOM      SERCOM index reading the phototransistor (USART RX)
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_RX_PAD         SERCOM pad the sensor pin lands on (0..3)
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_RX_PIN         pin name as declared in pins.h (e.g. IRSENSE)
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_RX_PMUX        HAL_GPIO_PMUX_SERCOM or HAL_GPIO_PMUX_SERCOM_ALT
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_RX_ENABLE_PIN  (optional) pin gating the phototransistor bias
 *   WATCH_OPTICAL_RX_ENABLE_ACTIVE_LOW  1 if driving it low powers the bias ON
 *
 * NB: HAS_OPTICAL_LINK is deliberately distinct from gossamer's HAS_IR_SENSOR.
 * The latter means "the phototransistor exists and can be read via the ADC"
 * (light_sensor_face); this one means "TX + RX are wired to SERCOMs and the
 * serial link is usable". A board may have one without the other.
